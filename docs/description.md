Spaced repetition without the repetition!

MemoBeam modulates electromagnetic signals in your monitor to produce <b>Ebbinghaus waves</b>. These stimulate the <b>hippocampus</b>, a key area of your brain responsible for transfering information into long-term memory. This allows us to directly <b>beam flashcards into your memory</b>, sparing you from having to deal with those pesky reviews:
